# Jiggle

**This project is barely started. Come back another day.**

A combination of [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and [WebGL](https://github.com/djalbat/Easy).

# Installation

You can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/Jiggle.git

...and then install the necessary modules with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

## Compiling from source

Automation is done with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), have a look at the `package.json` file. The pertinent commands are:

    npm run build-debug
    npm run watch-debug
    
As well as building the Jiggle library itself, this will build the examples. The source code for the two examples can be found in the `es6/examples` directory. To view the compiled examples, open the `examples/index.html` file.
