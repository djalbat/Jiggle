## Compiling from source

Automation is done with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), have a look at the `package.json` file. The pertinent commands are:

    npm run build-debug
    npm run watch-debug
    
As well as building the Jiggle library itself, this will build the examples. The source code for the two examples can be found in the `es6/examples` directory. To view the compiled examples, open the `examples/index.html` file.
